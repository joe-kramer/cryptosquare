# _Cryptosquare_

#### _Encrypt any message using the technique of a Cryptosquare, June 8th, 2017_

#### By _**Joe Kramer**_

## Description

_A classic method for composing secret messages is called a square code. The spaces and punctuation are removed from the English text and the characters are written into a square (or rectangle) and the entire message is lowercased. The coded message is obtained by reading down the columns going left to right, outputting encoded text in groups of five letters._

## Specifications

* _Lowercase message_
* _Remove punctuation and spaces_
* _Example of above exception: So instead of writing IIII for 4, you write IV (for 5 minus 1); and instead of writing LXXXX for 90, you write XC._
* _You have to separate ones, tens, hundreds, and thousands. In other words, 99 is XCIX, not IC._
* _You cannot count higher than 3,999 in Roman numerals._
